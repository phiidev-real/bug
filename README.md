# Bug Engine
The definitive entomological game engine. 

# Using larva.py
To compile the project, run
`larva.py`
As the engine is incomplete and larva.py is designed in a really poor way I'm conflicted on whether or not I should add an explination. 
Run the file and input the version with text. If you submit a number it will crash (working on it). 
It will automatically scan the directories for object files to compile and compile the main function. 

Larva currently only supports g++, but I will probably add support for other compilers.
